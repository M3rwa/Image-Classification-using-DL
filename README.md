# Image Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Image Classifier Project.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of an image classification project using Deep Learning techniques.

## Introduction

Image classification is a popular application of Deep Learning that involves training a model to recognize and categorize images into predefined classes or labels. Deep Learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are commonly used for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn and extract meaningful features from images.

This project aims to showcase the process of building an image classifier using Deep Learning. The notebook walks through the various stages, including data preparation, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The notebook utilizes a dataset of images for training and evaluation. Unfortunately, the specific dataset used in this project is not specified in the repository. It is recommended to refer to the notebook itself or the associated documentation to obtain information about the dataset used and its structure.

## Requirements

To run the notebook and execute the code, the following dependencies are required:

- Python: The programming language used for the project.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment for running and modifying the notebook.
- Deep Learning Frameworks: The specific Deep Learning framework(s) used for building and training the image classifier. Common frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.

It is advisable to set up a Python environment with the necessary dependencies before running the notebook.
